# System-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  DriverPass was a company looking to help people pass their driving test to get their liscence. They wanted us to create a system that would allow customers access to  study material, practice problems, and practice tests. They also wanted to provide driving practice with experienced drivers. Therefore, the system would also        include the ability to schedule these driving appointments. 

What did you do particularly well?
  I believe I did a particularly good job at capturing the system requirements in UML diagrams. They really helped me understand the different aspects necessary to  accomplish the company's wishes. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would work on improving the functional and nonfunctional requirements. I did not feel very confident in what I was talking about in those sections and it shows. I need to do more research in order to improve those sections. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I interpreted them as plainly as I could. We only had one recorded interview to work off of as opposed to an open line of communication, so I had to fill in a few holes in there. The user's needs should be the developer's top priority to understand because they are the ones you are building the application for. You aren't building it for yourself. Therefore, you need their input of what they want and need in the system. You also want to avoid an anticlamatic reveil of your product, where the client does not want it because you didn't deliver what they requested.
